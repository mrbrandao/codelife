# 
# ---- ISCA CV CODE ----
#
# This is a simple script to diplay my Curriculum Vitae
#
#   What it must do?
#   * build a ascii board in pure born again shell
#   * display text arrays formatted as a block
#   * show the page number at botton
#   * paginate pressing numbers
#
#   - Why do not you, just make an echo to everything?
#   > What would be the fun?
#
#   - Why not use dialogs?
#   > I don't want any external dependencies just bash3+ and binutils.
#   > And btw, ascii is nice classic hack style, which is more fun...
#   
#   You need bash3+ to run this script, i'm using nested "for" loops and arrays
#   will not work on bash2- 
#   To make math calcs more compatible with bash3, i'm using expr insted $((+))
